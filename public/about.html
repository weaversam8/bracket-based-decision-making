            <p><code>bracket-based-decision-making</code> is a project whose goal is to enable you to choose
                from a list of options that you (think you) like equally.
            </p>
            <p>As the name suggests, it works by initially making you fill out a bracket containing all of the things you are trying to make a decision about. For example, if you have to do homework, wash dishes, and take the dog out for a walk, you should add a bracket item for each of these tasks.</p>
            <p>Next, you'll be prompted, two items at a time, to choose which thing you'd prefer to do more. Continuing with our original example, you might initially be prompted to choose between doing homework and taking the dog out for a walk. Let's say you chose doing homework (unlikely). Then, you'd be prompted to choose between doing homework and washing dishes. After making this decision -- <i>let's say you chose washing dishes</i> -- the decision bracket would be completely filled out and you will have resolved on what decision to make first -- namely, washing dishes.</p>
            <p>The key idea is that you can do this multiple times a day for many different decisions, and by reducing the number of choices you have to consider to two items at a time, the things you'd <i>really</i> prefer to do naturally advance forward in the bracket.</p>
